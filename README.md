# Horiseon Social Solution Services Website

This is a simple HTML and CSS code for the Horiseon Social Solution Services website. The website provides information about various digital marketing services offered by Horiseon, including Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing. The purpose of making this website was to demonstrate the importance of accessibility when writing code and for me personally, learning how semantic HTML helps people with impairments navigate a website.
